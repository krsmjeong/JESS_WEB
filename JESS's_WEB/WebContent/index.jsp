	<p>This is my first website. I used <Strong>Java, html, CSS, JavaScript, mysql</Strong> and <strong>jsp</strong> for making this website. You know, this means that I am able to control these programming languages. And I also can control <strong>AndroidStudio</strong> with Java as well. I'm not perfect yet. <Strong>but</Strong>, I will be a perfect programmer as soon. Thank you for visiting my website and Thank you for reading. </p>
